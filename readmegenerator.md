# Description
    Using NodeJS and inquirer and Fs, I created a readme generator app using cli propmts from inquirer. After the propmts are followed the info is written onto a markdown using Fs and a template is given to the markdown in order to create anchor links. 
# Installation
    Inquirer
# Contributors
    none
# Instructions
    First, you install the required packages, then you run the file in node. Once you run it in node, CLI prompts will inquire the necessary info from you in order to create your readme file.
